# Particle (PARTICLE)

## Description

The Particle engine generates sound by simulating the movement and interaction of particles. It can be used to create complex and evolving textures, such as rain, fire, or swarms of insects.

## Parameters

*   **Particle Count:** [The number of particles to simulate.]
*   **Particle Size:** [The size of each particle.]
*   **Particle Speed:** [The speed of the particles.]
*   **Particle Damping:** [The damping factor applied to the particle movement.]
*   **Particle Interaction:** [The type of interaction between particles (e.g., attraction, repulsion).]
*   **Particle Emission:** [The rate at which particles are emitted.]

## Implementation Notes

[This engine requires a physics engine to simulate the particle movement. The particle parameters can be modulated to create dynamic and evolving textures. Consider using collision detection to simulate particle interactions.]
