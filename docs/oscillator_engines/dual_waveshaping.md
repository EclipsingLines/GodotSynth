# Dual Waveshaping (DWS)

## Description

Dual Waveshaping is an extension of the waveshaping technique that applies two waveshaping functions in series or parallel. This allows for more complex and interesting timbral variations.

## Parameters

*   **Shape 1:** [Description of the first waveshaping function.]
*   **Amount 1:** [The amount of distortion applied by the first waveshaping function.]
*   **Shape 2:** [Description of the second waveshaping function.]
*   **Amount 2:** [The amount of distortion applied by the second waveshaping function.]
*   **Mix:** [The balance between the two waveshaping functions (series or parallel).]
*   **Pre-gain:** [Gain applied to the signal before waveshaping.]
*   **Post-gain:** [Gain applied to the signal after waveshaping.]

## Implementation Notes

[Consider implementing both series and parallel configurations. Experiment with different combinations of waveshaping functions for each stage. Optimization is important for real-time performance.]
