# Filtered Noise (FILTERED NOISE)

## Description

The Filtered Noise engine generates noise and then filters it to create a variety of timbral variations. This can be used to create wind sounds, rain sounds, or other textured sounds.

## Parameters

*   **Noise Type:** [Selects the type of noise to generate (e.g., white, pink, brown).]
*   **Filter Type:** [Selects the type of filter to use (e.g., lowpass, highpass, bandpass).]
*   **Filter Frequency:** [The cutoff frequency of the filter.]
*   **Filter Resonance:** [The resonance of the filter.]

## Implementation Notes

[This engine combines a noise generator with a filter. The filter parameters can be modulated to create dynamic and evolving textures. Consider using different filter types and noise types to create a wide range of sounds.]
