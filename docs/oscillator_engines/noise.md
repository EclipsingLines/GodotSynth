# Noise (NOISE)

## Description

The Noise engine generates various types of noise, such as white noise, pink noise, and brown noise. These noise signals can be used for a variety of purposes, such as creating percussive sounds, adding texture to other sounds, or generating random events.

## Parameters

*   **Type:** [Selects the type of noise to generate (e.g., white, pink, brown).]
*   **Level:** [The amplitude of the noise signal.]
*   **Seed:** [The seed for the random number generator.]

## Implementation Notes

[White noise can be generated using a simple random number generator. Pink noise and brown noise can be generated by filtering white noise. Consider using a high-quality random number generator for best results.]
