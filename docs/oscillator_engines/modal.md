# Modal (MODAL)

## Description

The Modal engine generates sound by simulating the resonant modes of a physical object. It can be used to create realistic and expressive sounds of vibrating strings, plates, or other resonant structures.

## Parameters

*   **Mode 1 Frequency:** [The frequency of the first resonant mode.]
*   **Mode 2 Frequency:** [The frequency of the second resonant mode.]
*   **Mode 3 Frequency:** [The frequency of the third resonant mode.]
    [Add more modes as needed]
*   **Mode 1 Damping:** [The damping factor of the first resonant mode.]
*   **Mode 2 Damping:** [The damping factor of the second resonant mode.]
*   **Mode 3 Damping:** [The damping factor of the third resonant mode.]
    [Add more modes as needed]
*   **Excitation:** [The type of excitation applied to the modes (e.g., impulse, noise).]

## Implementation Notes

[This engine can be implemented using a bank of resonant filters. The filter coefficients can be derived from physical modeling equations or measured from real-world objects. Consider using modal synthesis techniques to efficiently simulate the resonant modes.]
